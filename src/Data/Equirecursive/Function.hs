-- OOOH, I think I can solve part of the type equality within
-- MapX, UnfoldX, etc. It will only work for prepared cases,
-- but I should be able to make an AnyType newtype that I can
-- safely coerce to/from. Ideally, it would have the NotXY constraint,
-- but I think I can make it work anyway, and possibly even incorporate
-- the NotXY constraint to cover some cases. Hmmmmmm.... Recursive injectivity would be very nice.


-- | Need to check how `XY` is recognized in other places.
-- I think there are a couple cases where @`X` (`X` :: `Nat` -> `Type`)@
-- would be recognized as `XY`, "just to be safe".
--
-- Yay for when injectivity actually works!
--
-- Note: all this is cool, and I should definately apply it to
-- theorems about arbitrary RecurseL's, but I think this specifically is
-- actually all covered by (==)!
type family NotXY1 (a :: Type) = (c :: Constraint) | c -> a where
  NotXY1 XY = () ~ XY
  NotXY1 a  = a  ~ a

-- | So this is neat, it's possible to use staged checks
-- to narrow down the search space. This family essentially says:
-- "Hey, ya know how XY :: Type? Well so then like everything else
-- can't be XY."
type family NotXY4 (a :: k   ) :: Constraint where
  NotXY4 (a :: Type) = NotXY3 a
  NotXY4 (a :: k   ) = a ~ a

-- | This checks whether the type is the result of exactly one
-- application, throwing out things like @`MaybeT` m a@, without
-- even knowing @m@ or @a@! Also helpful things like @(a, b)@.

--   coerceRec :: RecurseL (s , t ) -> (s                , t                )


-- | TODO: These classes play loose with unsafeCoerce. That shouldn't happen.
-- Should probably make a `NotXY` constraint and sprinkle it around these modules
-- liberally. That, plus adding proofs for `rec`/`pull` on these types should make
-- everything a bit safer.
--
-- Idea for that:
-- NotXY a => EList a :~: (a, EList a)
-- NotXY a => RecurseL (a, XY) :~: (a, RecurseL (a, XY))
--
-- Can probably TemplateHaskell it up a bit to make instances for a number of datatypes.
-- Hmm... What about a general interface?
-- NotXY a => CoerceXY a
-- CoerceXY a => CoerceXY (a, XY)
-- CoerceXY a => CoerceXY (XY, a)
--
-- It seems possible that I could make it work for a number of simpler types. The trick is
-- to make sure they resolve nicely when instantiated.
--
--
-- Also, should remember to make rec' that's determined more by argument than result, like rec is.
-- rec' should probably fail with a TypeError.


-- - a $ function for RecurseL (a -> c XY), which is much more limited than an automatic push

--      ($) :: RecurseL (a -> c XY) -> a -> RecurseL (a -> c XY)
--      (supposing that we have a way to get inside `c`.)
