-- - a $ function for RecurseL (a -> c XY), which is much more limited than an automatic push
--    Could even do something like:
--      ($) :: RecurseL (a -> c XY) -> a -> RecurseL (a -> c XY)
--      (supposing that we have a way to get inside `c`.)
-- - convert a function into one that allows reporting its arguments: Partial: partial
-- - an infinite-type based printf: Nary: naryl ++ Exists Show
-- - generic infinite-type functions: Nary: naryl, naryr
